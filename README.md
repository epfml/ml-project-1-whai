# P1 Machine Learning: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) prediction.
# Participants
Alexi Semiz, Anton Balykov, Anthony Kalaydjian

# The project:
Thanks to the exponentially increasing ammount of data in the medical domain, learning methods have proven to have great success. The case of this study focuses on Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) prediction, and looks to find its correlations with different features. Comparing different models yields the choice of a thresholded ridge regression which predicts CVD with an f1-scores of 0.414 on a test set.

# Different files:
The main notbook of the study is run.ipynb
The useful preprocessing functions are in preprocessing.py
The required functions are in implementations.py. in this file we added some other functions that helped us to conduct the study.
The neural network computed is in neural_network_model.py. It will not be useful for our models but we used it as a comparison.
All the relevant plots (grid_searchs for example) that did not have a place in the report are in the plots folders.
